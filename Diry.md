1. The stack:

I can try to use vue, but i have not a lot of experiance with it, and can not spand a lot of time for this task. Then i prefere React stack.

For now i think i will not use any state manager.

To work with websockets decided to use:

react-use-websocket. Do not wont spend time to writ socket wrapper by myself.

Considered about react-websocket, but noticed that this library was last updated 4 years ago, decided to use react-use-websocket(but they not answer on the issues for the month), can not say that i will be use this library in production, but look good for this test task.

For components will use storybook

2. Plan

I do not have any design in this task. Will make some fast design in figma to have reference: test
